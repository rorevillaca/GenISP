## **Introduction**

Scientific publications should contain enough information (through explanations, diagrams, pseudocode, equations, etc) to allow reproductibility of the reported results with relatively low effort. While doing the reproduction, we underwent all sorts of challenges, including but not limited to:
* Lack of understanding of the problem
* Not enough information /details provided on the method
* No justifications provided for design decisions
* Versioning/legacy issues
